LLLPG is a recursive-decent parser generator for C#, with a feature set better than ANTLR version 2. It's one of the only parser generators designed for _coders_: it generates clean, straightforward code, only slightly uglier than you would write by hand, and it's convenient for small parsing tasks, not just big ones.

To learn more, [read the FAQ](faq.html) or the five-part article series about LLLPG:

- [Part 1](lllpg-part-1.html)
- [Part 2](lllpg-part-2.html)
- [Part 3](lllpg-part-3.html)
- [Part 4](lllpg-part-4.html)
- [Part 5](lllpg-part-5.html)

Or see the original series [on CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/664785/A-New-Parser-Generator-for-Csharp). It includes a download link, but to make sure you get the current version, you should go to the [release repo](https://github.com/qwertie/LLLPG-Release) and click "Download ZIP".
